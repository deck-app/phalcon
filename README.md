# Phalcon
## Introduction
Phalcon is an open source web framework delivered as a C extension for the PHP language providing high performance and lower resource consumption.

## Getting started
The quickest way to get started with the Deck Laravel Development Container is using docker-compose.

Begin by creating a directory for your Laravel application:
```
mkdir ~/myapp
cd ~/myapp
```
Clone the application directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/deck-app/phalcon.git
$ cd phalcon
```
Finally launch the Laravel application development environment using:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
